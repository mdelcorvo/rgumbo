[Gumbo](https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/creole-chicken-gumbo-soup/15686514-d713-4056-bd2e-60cd68b20f9d), like any other soup, is a mixture of different ingredients. This one in particular is made with a dark roux, vegetables, chicken, sausage, shrimp and served over rice. 
Except that instead of tasty food and fresh ingredients, `rgumbo` provides you with R functions.

This package is a result of me constantly breaking the DRY principle
by copy-and-pasting functions from old projects into new ones. Hence, the
functions in `rgumbo` do not have a single common topic, but they are all either
related to manipulating genomic data or general
productivity utilities.

This package  has several functions that can prove to be useful and time-saving if you happen to need
to perform one of the tasks implemented by `rgumbo`.

## Installation

rgumbo is currently only available through GitHub and can be downloaded
easily using devtools.
